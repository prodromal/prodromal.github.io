# Create your own Lunacy link!
Follow these instructions to make your own lunacy chat link.
## Step 1: Get the code for the chat
Go to <<<view-source:https://prodromal.github.io/links/lunacy.html>>>. Include the view-source: and everything else. Copy the entire code in the page by clicking anywhere on it and pressing "ctrl+A"
## Step 1.5: OPTIONAL- for devs only 
If you have another chat API, you can replace ours and also change the name.
## Step 2: Find a website that can deploy your code for you.
These work for deploying html (there are others, but you'll have to find them): github.io, pages.dev, netlify, vercel, etc
## Step 3: Create an account
Use either your own email, school email, or go to temp-mail.org to get an email and make an account.
## Step 4: Create the website
Depending on which website you are using to help you make the link, you might have to make a repo first. You should probably make a base repo (example: your username is bob, your base repo will be bob.github.io)
## Step 5: Paste the code into "index.html"
And publish, and your website is live!
## Step 6 (kinda optional) Send your link to us!
Send your link to gleam-report@iname.com. You may add advertisements to the webpage if you want.
